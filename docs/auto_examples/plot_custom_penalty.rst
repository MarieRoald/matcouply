Example with custom penalty class for unimodality for all but one component
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, we first demonstrate how to specify exactly how the penalties are imposed in the AO-ADMM fitting
procedure. Then, we create a custom penalty that imposes non-negativity on all component vectors and unimodality on all
but one of the component vectors.

Generate simulated data that follows the PARAFAC2 constraint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We start by generating some components, for the :math:`\mathbf{A}` and :math:`\mathbf{C}` components, we use uniformly
distributed component vector elements. For the :math:`\mathbf{B}^{(i)}`-components, we create two unimodal vectors and one
component vector with uniformly distributed elements, and shift these vectors for each :math:`i`.

Use the ``regs`` parameter to input regularization classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Matcouply automatically parses the constraints from the ``parafac2_aoadmm`` and ``cmf_aoadmm`` funciton
arguments. However, sometimes, you may want full control over how a penalty is implemented. In that case,
the ``regs``-argument is useful. This argument makes it possible to specify exactly which penalty instances
to use.

Since the components are non-negative, it makes sense to fit a non-negative PARAFAC2 model, however,
we also know that two of the :math:`\mathbf{B}^{(i)}`-component vectors are unimodal, so we first try with
a fully unimodal decomposition.

We see that the :math:`\mathbf{C}`-component vectors all follow the same pattern and that the the
:math:`\mathbf{A}`-component vectors all follow a similar pattern. This is not the case with the real,
uncorrelated random, components. The :math:`\mathbf{B}^{(i)}`-component vectors also follow a strange pattern
with peaks jumping forwards and backwards, which we know are not the case with the real components either.

However, this strange behaviour is not too surprising, considering that there are only two uniomdal component
vectors in the data. So this model that assumes all unimodal components might be too restrictive.

Create a custom penalty class for unimodality in all but one class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Now, we want to make a custom penalty that imposes unimodality on the first :math:`R-1` component
vectors. Since unimodality are imposed column-wise, we know that this constraint is a matrix penalty
(as opposed to a row-vector penalty or a multi-matrix penalty), so we import the ``MatrixPenalty``-superclass
from ``matcouply.penalties``. We also know that unimodality is a hard constraint, so we import
the ``HardConstraintMixin``-class, which provides a ``penalty``-method that always returns 0 and has an informative
docstring.

We see that the model finds much more sensible component vectors. The :math:`\mathbf{A}`- and
:math:`\mathbf{C}`-component vectors no longer seem correlated, and the peaks of the :math:`\mathbf{B}^{(i)}`-component
vectors no longer jump around.
